# 10-Dollar-Robot
I run a robotics club in a school, for students aged 11 – 14. We generally use a Raspberry Pi for the brains in our robots, but by the time you've added on motor controllers, voltage converters, wireless controllers etc... to the price of the Pi – It all starts to get rather expensive!
 
I wanted to make an all in one simple robotics controller, that was cheap enough to give to each of the students to keep, so once they had built their robots they could take them home to continue tinkering.
